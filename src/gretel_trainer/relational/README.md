# Relational

## Quickstart

```python
from gretel_trainer.relational.connectors import sqlite_conn
from gretel_trainer.relational.multi_table import MultiTable

connection = sqlite_conn(path="my_data.db")
relational_data = connection.extract()
multitable = MultiTable(relational_data)
multitable.train()
synthetic_tables = multitable.generate()
```

## Overview of Python objects

### `RelationalData`

This core data structure holds individual table data and table relationship metadata.
It can be created and modified manually, or can be extracted from a database via a
`Connector` instance.


### `Connector`

A `Connector` automates the extraction of table data and metadata from a database to
a `RelationalData` instance. `Connector`s can also write synthetic data to a database.

A handful of helper functions exist to create `Connector` instances for some popular
databases, but this set is not exhaustiveâ€”your mileage may vary depending on complex
native database types, but generally speaking if you can create a
[SQLAlchemy Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html) for your
database, you can use the `Connector` class. Engines almost always require local
installation of database drivers like `psycopg2-binary` (PostgreSQL) or `mysqlclient`
(MySQL/MariaDB). The optional `[relational]` installation package installs the
drivers necessary for all the helper functions mentioned above. For more information,
see the [SQLAlchemy dialects docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/dialects/index.html).


### `MultiTable`

This is the interface to working with `RelationalData`, including running transforms
on it, training synthetic models on it and generating data from those models, and
evaluating synthetic results.
