      <h2>Synthetic Data Quality Results</h2>

      <p>For each table, individual and cross-table Gretel Synthetic Reports are generated, which include the Synthetic Data
      Quality Score (SQS). The individual Synthetic Report evaluates the statistical accuracy of the individual synthetic table compared to the real world data that it is
      based on. This provides insight into the accuracy of the synthetic output of the stand-alone
      table. The individual SQS does not take into account statistical correlations of data across related tables. The
      cross-table Synthetic Report evaluates the statistical accuracy of the synthetic data of a table with consideration to the
      correlations between data across related tables. The cross-table SQS provides insight into the accuracy of the
      table in the context of the database as a whole. More information about the Gretel Synthetic Report and Synthetic Data Quality Score is
      available <a href="https://docs.gretel.ai/reference/synthetics/gretel-synthetic-report">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Synthetic Data Quality Scores</h2>

        <p>For each table, individual and cross-table synthetic data quality scores (SQS) are computed and displayed below.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Table</th>
              <th scope="col">Individual SQS</th>
              <th scope="col">Cross-Table SQS</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          {% for table, evaluation in presenter.evaluations.items() %}
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">{{table}}</th>
              <td style="text-align: center">{{evaluation.individual_sqs}}</td>
              <td style="text-align: center">{{evaluation.cross_table_sqs}}</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
          {% endfor %}
        </table>

        <p> The Synthetic Data Quality Score is an estimate of how well the generated synthetic data maintains the same statistical properties as the original dataset. In this sense, the Synthetic Data Quality Score can be viewed as a utility score or a confidence score as to whether scientific conclusions drawn from the synthetic dataset would be the same if one were to have used the original dataset instead. If you do not require statistical symmetry, as might be the case in a testing or demo environment, a lower score may be just as acceptable.</p>
        <p> If your Synthetic Data Quality Score isn't as high as you'd like it to be, read <a href="https://docs.gretel.ai/reference/synthetics/tips-improve-synthetic-data-accuracy">here</a> for a multitude of ideas for improving your model.</p>
